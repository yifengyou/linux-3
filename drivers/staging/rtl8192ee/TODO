TODO:
- convert any remaining unusual variable types
- find codes that can use %pM and %Nph formatting
- checkpatch.pl fixes - most of the remaining ones are lines too long. Many
  of them will require refactoring
- merge Realtek's bugfixes and new features into the driver
- Convert the versions of rtlwifi and btcoexist in drivers/net/wireless/rtlwifi/...
  to work with the RTL8192EE
- move this driver to drivers/net/wireless/rtlwifi

Please send any patches to Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linux.com>,
and Larry Finger <Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net>.
