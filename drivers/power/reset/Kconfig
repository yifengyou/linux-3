menuconfig POWER_RESET
	bool "Board level reset or power off"
	help
	  Provides a number of drivers which either reset a complete board
	  or shut it down, by manipulating the main power supply on the board.

	  Say Y here to enable board reset and power off

config POWER_RESET_AS3722
	bool "ams AS3722 power-off driver"
	depends on MFD_AS3722 && POWER_RESET
	help
	  This driver supports turning off board via a ams AS3722 power-off.

config POWER_RESET_AXXIA
	bool "LSI Axxia reset driver"
	depends on POWER_RESET && ARCH_AXXIA
	help
	  This driver supports restart for Axxia SoC.

	  Say Y if you have an Axxia family SoC.

config POWER_RESET_GPIO
	bool "GPIO power-off driver"
	depends on OF_GPIO && POWER_RESET
	help
	  This driver supports turning off your board via a GPIO line.
	  If your board needs a GPIO high/low to power down, say Y and
	  create a binding in your devicetree.

config POWER_RESET_MSM
	bool "Qualcomm MSM power-off driver"
	depends on POWER_RESET && ARCH_QCOM

	  Power off and restart support for Qualcomm boards.

config POWER_RESET_QNAP
	bool "QNAP power-off driver"
	depends on OF_GPIO && POWER_RESET && PLAT_ORION
	help
	  This driver supports turning off QNAP NAS devices by sending
	  commands to the microcontroller which controls the main power.

	  Say Y if you have a QNAP NAS.

config POWER_RESET_RESTART
	bool "Restart power-off driver"
	depends on ARM
	help
	  Some boards don't actually have the ability to power off.
	  Instead they restart, and u-boot holds the SoC until the
	  user presses a key. u-boot then boots into Linux.
